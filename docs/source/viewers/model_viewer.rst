Model Viewer
============

The model viewer code can load and render any supported Scene data.

It also supports any physics information present on the Scene data,
starting the simulation as soon as the load process finished.

By default this object renders the bounding volumes of the lights on the scenes
and optionally the wireframe version of the physics geometry when its property `drawPhysicsGeometry` is set to true.
