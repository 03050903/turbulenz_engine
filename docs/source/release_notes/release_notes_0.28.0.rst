New Features

Changes
-------

* The *plugin-debug* build mode has been deprecated.  The SDK no
  longer contains the *plugin-debug* version of any samples or apps,
  and developers should not rely upon support for this build mode in
  any tools.  The *canvas-debug* mode is the recommended way to use
  the browser debugging tools.

* Mac OS X 10.6 and Safari 5 are no longer officially supported.  This
  removes the need for any browser plugin on Mac OS X platforms, and
  so the *TurbulenzEngine* binary installers are no longer bundled
  with SDKs or available for download.
